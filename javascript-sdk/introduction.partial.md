# Marketcloud Javascript SDK

This is the documentation for the official Marketcloud Javascript SDK. It is a wrapper for our REST api and it makes it easier to use. This document provides an API reference for versions 2.0.0 and above of the SDK, we highly recommend to use the latest version of the SDK and before upgrading, please read the [changelog](https://github.com/Marketcloud/marketcloud-js/wiki/Note-for-Version-2.0.0).

## Introduction

If you haven't set up an application yet, please refer to the [Getting Started](/documentation/rest-api/gettingstarted) section. You can also check out our API Reference for more detailed information about our SDK.

In Marketcloud, you create an App for each of your web/mobile applications. Each App has its own public key that you insert into your web app. Your account on Marketcloud can handle multiple Apps.
